            <strong>Let me tell you about ElanHub Media. 

            <em><u>Elanhub Media</u></em> is a Nigerian digital media platform dedicated to the publication of news, opinion, entertainment and inspirational content such as daily devotionals. Although there many news platforms in Nigeria, Elanhub prioritises content that is relevant to Rivers State and southern Nigeria. This is in order to address the dearth of news and information about the state and the region on traditional news outlets.
            At Elanhub, their mission is to become the <em><u>leading platform for factual content about Rivers State, Southern Nigeria and the World</u></em>. As a team, they are bettering themselves at providing their audience with quality and reliable content, while emphasising both establishment and counter-establishment perspectives on trending topics.
            They also engage in the <u>training and development of future leaders</u> especially in South-South Nigeria. Their training covers a wide range of media related courses including <em>News Writing, Crisis Management, Public Speaking, Public Relations, Advertising, Filmmaking/Videography, ICT and more.</em> </strong>
            I am priveleged to be a part of the current set of trainees being trained on <em>"The fundamentals of Web Design.</em> Our instructor, Mr. Uche is a professional web designer and software developer and the training has been a wholesome experience so far.
